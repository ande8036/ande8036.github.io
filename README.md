--This README.md has been created for the purpose of being part of an e-portfolio. It doesn't actually have anything to do with this website.

This webpage functions as a personal website. It contains four pages with different information regarding my life. The first page, the home page, simply has a picture of me, and a brief description of who I am. The second page, contains information on projects I've worked on. The first project is 8-puzzle, that I worked on in my AI class. The second, a program called Prism that I worked on during my internship. The third, a sequence diagram I created for capstone. Each project on this page has an associated image. The third page contains a very detailed replica of my real resumé. It contains information such as my work history, education, skills, etc. It also contains a download link for a pdf of my original resumé. The fourth and last page contains "fun stuff". It has information on my trip to Washington D.C., as well as some pictures. The pages all have the same background, similar CSS styles, as well as an off canvas menu for accessing other pages.

According to the portfolio rubric, one of the "signature works" has to be from a discipline outside of CS. If that is so, I choose my resumé from this page. If opening resume.html, at the bottom is a download link for it. I made it before making the webpage, and it took a lot of time and effort. It shows information on my skills, education, work history, and on my Eagle Scout project.
